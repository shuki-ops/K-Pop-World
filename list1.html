This was soon followed by wins on M Countdown and Show Champion "Crown" made it on to GQ's Decade-end list of "The game-changers from a decade of K-pop", for the year 2019, with GQ writing, "The bright, effervescent pop of TXT who, despite being BTS’s younger sibling group, are in their own element as they playfully explore teenage growing pains."On April 9, 2019, TXT announced their first-ever overseas tour, a six-show debut showcase in the United States encompassing six American cities- New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Orlando, and Atlanta over the course of about two weeks, from May 9 to 24.
