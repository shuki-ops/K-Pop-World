            Jung Ho-seok (Korean: 정호석; born February 18, 1994), better known by his stage name J-Hope, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter and record producer. In 2013, J-Hope made his debut as a member of the South Korean BTS, managed under Big Hit Entertainment. J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, Hope World, worldwide on March 1, 2018. The album was met with a positive reception. His debut at number 63 (and subsequent peak at number 38) made him the highest charting solo Korean artist on the Billboard 200 at the time of the mixtape's release. In September 27 2019, he released his song ”Chicken Noodle Soup” featuring Becky G.

          J-Hope was born as Jung Ho-seok (Korean: 정호석) on February 18, 1994, in Gwangju, South Korea, where he lived with his parents and older sister. Before debuting with BTS, he was part of the underground dance team Neuron and took dance classes at Gwangju Music Academy. J-Hope had been relatively well known for his skills in dance prior to his debut; he won various local prizes for dance, including placing first in a national dance competition in 2008. His skills in dance eventually led him to gain interest in singing, helping him to audition as an idol trainee. As a trainee, J-Hope was featured as a rapper in Jo Kwon's song "Animal", which was released in 2012.

          <p>
            On June 13, 2013, J-Hope made his debut as a member of BTS on Mnet's M! Countdown with the track "No More Dream" from their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. He was the third member to join the group as a trainee after RM and Suga. J-Hope has since been involved in the creation process of every album in BTS' discography.

              Well, this is also a kind of army, but a little different plan. And if without jokes, then this is the name of the BTS group fandom for k-pop fans and the state armed forces for ordinary people.
